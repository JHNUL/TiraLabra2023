# Specifications

## Programming language

Project is implemented in Java. In addition I can do code review for projects implemented in Python or JavaScript.

## Topic of the project

This project uses Markov's Chain to predict the next note in a melody. The idea is to implement at least 1st and 2nd degree Markov's Chains. I play guitar myself and have studied music in my youth, so the topic of generating music and getting to know something about machine learning in practice made me choose this topic.

## Data structures and algorithms used

- Trie data structure
- Markov's Chain to predict the next note in a melody

## Inputs

The model is trained on a corpus of songs in musicxml format. I chose this format because I deemed it the least painful to parse. User inputs TBA.

## Time/space complexities

- Trie insertion O(?)
- Trie lookup O(?)
