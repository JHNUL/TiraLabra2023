# Specifications

## Programming language

Project is implemented in Java. In addition I can do code review for projects implemented in Python or JavaScript.

## Topic of the project

This project uses Markov's Chain to predict the next note in a melody. The idea is to implement at least 1st and 2nd degree Markov's Chains.

## Data structures and algorithms used

- Trie data structure
- Markov's Chain to predict the next note in a melody

## Inputs

The model is trained on a corpus of songs in musicxml format. I chose this format because I deemed it the least painful to parse. User selects:
- musical key
- markov chain degree

## Time/space complexities

- Trie insertion O(k), where k = key length
- Trie lookup O(k), where k = key length
- Trie prefix search O(k), where k = key length
