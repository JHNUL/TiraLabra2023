## Hours

|Amount|What I did|
|-|-|
|4|Scratching the surface of Markov Chains and Tries as both were totally unfamiliar to me.|
|6|Doing small tests with different libraries and machine-readable music notation formats. Banging head against the Java ecosystem after a long hiatus from it. Basically trying to figure out if I can produce anything with this topic or if I should change to something else.|
