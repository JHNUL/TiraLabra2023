## Week6

Produce staccato patterns with JFugue, completely drop generating xml. Quite big gains in terms of removing logic from parser and dropping the MelodyNote intermediate format. With staccato patterns it was easily possible to write the playback rhythm to MIDI file as well and that fixed the issue of rhythm being only for playback via the UI.

Allow higher degrees of Markov Chains, up to 50. Create most common initial sequence starting from base note of the key. Most common sequence max lenght is 3.
